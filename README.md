The MovieLens dataset is a publicly available collection of movie ratings and metadata curated by the GroupLens research group at the University of Minnesota. It contains millions of user-generated ratings for thousands of movies, along with information such as movie titles, genres, timestamps, and user IDs (anonymized). This dataset is widely used for building and evaluating recommender systems, conducting data analysis, and developing data visualization projects.
